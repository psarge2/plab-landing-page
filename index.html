                            <p>The American Society for the Positive Care of Children (2014) states that the inability to have long-lasting friendships and relationships are linked to bad parenting habits; also depression and low self-esteem, bullying and criminal behavior. Parenting Like a BOSS was created to ignite, inspire, and empower parents to be the best parents they can be for their precious gifts. With the stated effects of bad parenting, we can no longer allow our children to grow up by themselves in a society that would not love them as much as we do. There is no judgment but only encouragement for us to enthusiastically accept and wear our parental badges of honor and Parent Like a BOSS.</p>
